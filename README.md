A band tribute project.
Visitors should be able to:
- get information about the band and its members
- listen to audio files
- watch music videos 
- get information about future events
- contact the band via contact form and via links to social media sites. 

The design is to match the band image: dark, gloom and raw. 
The band's fans listen to metal music and prefer dark themes.

Prior to using the imagery, I have obtained written permission from The Committee - band. 
All photos, songs and lyrics are property of The Committee, and can be found here: http://thecommitteeband.weebly.com
