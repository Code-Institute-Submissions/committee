<h1>A band tribute project.</h1>

<h2>The Purpose:</h2>

<p>Build a static (front-end only) website for a band: The Committee. 
The design is to match the band image: dark, gloom and raw. 
The band's fans listen to metal music and prefer dark themes.</p>

<p>Visitors should be able to:
- get information about the band and its members
- listen to audio files
- watch music videos 
- get information about future events
- contact the band via contact form and via links to social media sites. </p>


<p>Prior to using the imagery, I have obtained written permission from The Committee - band. 
All photos, songs and lyrics are property of The Committee, and can be found here: http://thecommitteeband.weebly.com</p>


<h2>Technologies used:</h2>
HTML/HTML5<br>
CSS, Bootstrap<br>
JS/JQuery<br>

<h2>Testing:</h2>
Testing was done using Apache2 server running on Linux Mint.
Devices used: desktop devices: 13", 15", 21"
Touch devices: 
Xiaomi MI, Android 7.1.2
iPad mini 2, iOS 11.3
Google Pixel 1, Android 8.1.0
iPhone 5SE, iOS 10

- :hover used to highlight band members photos proved unusable on touch devices, and was addressed by adding: 
  @media (hover:hover) {
  .................
  }

- css @media property was used extensively to achieve consistens layout when displaying the project on various devices
